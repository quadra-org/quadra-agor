## The problem Agor addresses

Every team is being told to ramp on AI fast. Most are doing it in silos,
on laptops, without a shared place for the work to live — and it isn't
working. Specifically:

1. **AI agent work is trapped on individual laptops.** Sessions are
   private, dev envs are local, long-lived agents live in someone's
   `~/`, MCP servers are configured per-machine. Your team's AI work
   doesn't accumulate anywhere.
2. **Handoffs are a tax.** Sharing a piece of work means `git push`,
   `git pull`, "what prompt was that again?", `docker compose up`,
   rebuild context. Every hop loses something.
3. **Teams can't learn from each other, and models move faster than
   anyone can keep up alone.** No way to see how a teammate prompts,
   which model they're on, what worked. Everyone reinvents the same
   workflows in private — and by the time one person figures out what
   works for the current model, the model has shifted again.
4. **Local config hell.** Each developer wires up their own MCP servers,
   credentials, scripts. There's no shared place to publish an agent, a
   skill, or a workflow.
5. **Parallel work is still an afterthought.** Spinning up an agent is
   cheap now — parallel runs should be the _premise_, not the exception.
   But one branch / one terminal / one dev server is still the default.
6. **The CLI is the wrong medium long-term.** Today's coding CLIs are
   impressively pushing the limits of what a terminal can do, but the
   ceiling is real — no token meter, no structured tool blocks, no live
   presence, no spatial layout. Web + sockets is where this lives.
7. **The IDE is being eclipsed for this work.** IDEs are familiar and
   solid, but they're laid out for a single human editing files — not
   for orchestrating multiple agents with conversations, dev
   environments, and teammate presence. We need a higher-level control
   plane that sits _above_ the IDE: team-oriented, agent-oriented,
   multi-branch by default. Keep your IDE; attach it to Agor.

These bullets are the internal source. What propagates into customer-
facing copy is two compressed forms:

- **The long-paragraph compressor** ("Conversations vanish, branches
  collide, dev servers fight for ports, configs rot on individual
  laptops, parallel runs are an afterthought, and nobody can see what
  anyone else's agent is doing") — folds bullets #1–#5 into one rhythm.
- **The one-liner** ("One agent in a terminal is fine. Five agents
  across a team is chaos.") — the entire problem in two sentences. Used
  in the technical/skeptical "How we speak" lead below.

The "What Agor is" bullets that follow mirror these problems implicitly.
Don't label the mapping — the design is felt, not narrated.

## What Agor is — bullets, ranked

Sorted by importance, relevance, and market appetite. Use the top of this
list when picking what to highlight — feature pages, launch threads, deck
slides, sales conversations.

1. **A team workspace for AI agents.** Multiplayer is the core
   differentiator. Most agentic tools today are solo. Agor isn't. Why it
   matters:
   - **Shared branches and dev envs.** Engineers, reviewers, PMs, QA, and
     stakeholders rally around the _same_ live dev environment instead of
     "spin up your own to see it." One link, one running thing,
     everyone's looking at it.
   - **Shared AI sessions.** Work alongside teammates' agents in real
     time. Watch how others prompt, lift their patterns, standardize the
     workflows that work, codify the ones worth keeping as zone triggers.
   - **Cross-team observability.** Clarity on who's running what, which
     tools they use, how their workflows are structured, where tokens
     get spent. The team learns from itself.
2. **Branches as the anchor.** Every unit of work is a git branch —
   and a branch is where sessions, dev environments, zone-triggered
   standard prompts, issues, and PRs all converge. One entity to point
   at, one place where the full context of a piece of work lives.
3. **A Figma-like spatial canvas.** Boards are 2D — branches are cards,
   zones are regions, you arrange your work and your teammates see where
   you're at. The spatial layout is what makes the multiplayer real.
4. **Shared, long-lived assistants.** Persistent agents with identity, a
   file-based memory system, and a skill system (OpenClaw-inspired), with
   full access to Agor through its MCP server. Agor is the shared place
   where teams give birth to assistants, configure and teach them, and
   wire them into team channels through the message gateway (Slack,
   GitHub). Distinct from one-off sessions — assistants are durable
   coworkers.
5. **Multi-agent, multi-runtime.** Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode,
   Copilot — interchangeable per session. Pick the right tool for the job;
   don't lock yourself into one vendor.
6. **Observable end-to-end.** Every session, every prompt, every tool
   call, every dollar — visible, durable, queryable. Status dots,
   completion chimes, token + dollar accounting per prompt, full
   conversation history per branch. No more "what was that agent doing
   again."
7. **MCP-native.** Anything a user can do in Agor, an agent can do too.
   Sessions are auto-issued tokens; agents fork, spawn, schedule, and
   report on their own work.
8. **A scheduler.** Cron-style triggers for templated prompts. Powers
   assistant heartbeats, daily standups, scheduled audits.
9. **Self-hosted.** BSL 1.1, your repos, your DB (LibSQL or Postgres),
   your Unix users when you turn on full isolation.

## How we speak at a high level

One-liner for talks, intros, and DMs:

> _Agor is the team command center for everything you're doing with AI agents — Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, custom assistants — on a shared spatial canvas, with full observability and self-hosted isolation._

When the audience is technical and skeptical, lead with the problem:

> _One agent in a terminal is fine. Five agents across a team is chaos. Agor is the workspace that makes that scale._

When the audience is multiplayer-curious, lead with the Figma frame:

> _Think Figma's spatial canvas, applied to AI agents. You see your teammates, you see what their agents are running, you coordinate live instead of after-the-fact._

When the audience is non-engineering (PMs, QA, design, leadership), lead with the rally:

> _Agor is where the whole team — not just the engineer — gathers around a piece of work. The branch is the anchor: live dev env, agent conversations, the PR, the prompts that produced it. Everyone sees the same thing._

The Figma analogy is reserved for team / multiplayer / canvas framing —
it's the right reference there. Don't use it as the master tagline (the
"Figma for AI coding" framing we retired understates the product).

---

## What Agor is NOT

- **Not just for AI coding.** Persisted assistants and non-code workflows
  (Cards) are equal citizens.
- **Not an LLM or model gateway.** Bring your own runtime.
- **Not an IDE.** Roadmap is "bring your own IDE," attached to
  Agor-managed branches.
- **Not CI/CD.** Scheduler triggers prompts on a cadence; doesn't replace
  Actions/Buildkite/Argo.
- **Not closed SaaS.** Self-hosted-first, BSL 1.1.

## `/guide/` hierarchy — proposal

Current structure (`apps/agor-docs/pages/guide/_meta.ts`) is already
grouped Features / Reference / Development / Deployment, and works.
**Don't redesign. Tighten copy in place.** Cascade rollout scope:

1. **`pages/guide/index.mdx`** — collapse the four stacked taglines
   (lines 16, 18, 20, 22–23) to canonical tagline + short paragraph.
2. **`pages/index.mdx`** — replace Hero `subtitle` and `description`
   props with tagline + short paragraph.
3. **`README.md`** — replace lines 5–7 with tagline + short paragraph +
   top 3–4 bullets.
4. **`theme.config.tsx`** — replace default `description` (line 83),
   `fullTitle` suffix (line 85), and JSON-LD `description` (lines 179–181)
   with the one-liner.
5. **`package.json`** descriptions — root and `packages/agor-live`.
6. **Slugs left alone** — `multiplayer-social.mdx` and
   `multiplayer-unix-isolation.mdx` keep their names; the prefix overlap
   is acceptable.
7. **Closing pull-quote** at `pages/guide/index.mdx:192` ("git tracks
   code, Agor tracks the conversations that produced it") — retire.
   Observability is in the bullets above; it doesn't need a tagline.
8. **"Figma" references on feature pages** —
   `multiplayer-social.mdx:8` and `features-overview.mdx:70` are kept;
   they're the right place for the Figma-like-canvas framing per the
   "How we speak" section.
