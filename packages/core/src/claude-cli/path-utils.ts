/**
 * Path helpers for the Claude Code CLI on-disk session storage.
 *
 * The `claude` binary writes each session's transcript to:
 *
 *   ~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-id>.jsonl
 *
 * `<slug>` is the working directory the session was launched from, with every
 * `/` and `.` replaced by `-`. This rule was verified live on
 * `claude` v2.1.170 against multiple paths.
 *
 * See docs/internal/claude-code-cli-integration-analysis-2026-05-14.md
 * (Appendix A) for the live session sample these helpers were validated
 * against.

 * Slug a working-directory path the way the `claude` CLI does.
 *
 * Replaces every `/` and `.` with `-`. The path is NOT lowercased — the slug
 * preserves case so we can round-trip back to the absolute path if needed.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 *   /Users/max/projects/agor       → -Users-max-projects-agor
 *   /home/agor/.agor/repos/agor    → -home-agor--agor-repos-agor
 *   /tmp/foo.bar/baz               → -tmp-foo-bar-baz
 *
 * Note the `.agor` directory: the leading dot becomes `-` and the
 * surrounding `/` separators also become `-`, producing the `--` doubling.
 * This matches Anthropic's slug rule exactly.
